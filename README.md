# Introduction to Databases  
_A comprehensive introduction to relational databases and SQL_

## Course Description

This course provides foundational knowledge of relational databases, covering database design, the relational model, and practical SQL programming. It emphasizes real-world application through data modeling, normalization, and structured query development.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Explain the advantages of Database Management Systems (DBMS) over traditional file systems
- Understand and describe the Relational Model and Entity-Relationship (ER) Model
- Design and normalize database schemas up to Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Write SQL queries to:
  - Create and modify database structures
  - Insert, update, and delete records
  - Retrieve data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING`
  - Use joins to query multiple tables
- Use DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) effectively
